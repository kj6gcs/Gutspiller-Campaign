## After Killing the Old & Blind Lizard Man:

Complete looting: old stick, gorilla furs, knife, stone rod. Engraving/inscription in unknown language on twisty wood stick (approx 2' long).

We exit the room, and go to head deeper into the cavern. There's a gap with some pillars as stepping spots, and on one side is a vine/palm leaf rope as a hand hold. Under the rope is worn smooth, which indicates smaller creatures (approximately the size of a halfling) have most likely brushed against it while crossing over the years, wearing it down (there is a small ledge something that size can use as a foot hold to cross more safely). We use the ladder to push against the pillars, and they sway a bit, creaking and cracking. We decide _not_ to use the pillars, securing the ladder across the gap so we can all make it over at t6he same time (we can hear something making wet slapping sounds).  
We make it across to discover there are two lizard men throwing spears at us.

**_Begin Combat_**
We gain the upper hand and attack first. Hugo the Underpaid (Sam) crosses the cavern/room we're in, swinging his sword at one but missing. Mystiel gets a good whack in on one. I go to shoot an arrow at one but fumble (double 2's) and become entangled in my bow, gaining _disadvantage_ on my next turn.

Hugo goes again, and hits one of the lizard men, slicing off a chunk of the enemy's skin. Mystiel misses on his next shot. I fire an arrow with disadvantage and manage to strike the enemy in the eye socket, killing him. The remaining enemy whacks Mystiel, causing slight damage.

Hugo and I both miss, the lizard man misses as well.

Hugo and I both miss again. Mystiel is up again, swings with his mace, but misses. Lizard man misses again, as well.

Hugo misses. My arrow finds purchase in his shoulder, he strikes out but misses with his claws at Mystiel.

Hugo put the boot to him, knocking him down prone. Mystiel finishes the job with his mace, splattering the lizard man's head with his mace.

There's one more, attempting poorly to hide behind a rock. He has a stone tomahawk in his hand. Hugo yells "we come in peace," but all it does is hiss at us. Looks a little thicker and lighter than the others. Hugo steps into a little pool of water, which seems to enrage it, and it comes at him (maybe it's lizardmen eggs?)

Hugo goes to strike, but fumbles (double 2's). Mystiel hits it and it falls over dead. Hugo and Mystiel smash the rest of the eggs to prevent further issues.
**_End Combat_**

## Past the Rookery:

The room narrows into a path, we can see a round door similar to the one we encountered at the stairs at the entrance to the cavern. Hugo goes down to it (slight slope) and finds a small hole in the center of the door. He slides the rod in. Pushing hard, he is able to unlock the door and we can slide it open about half way. Hugo removes the rod and we enter the next, larger room.

##

Inside this room, is a slight putrid smell, different from the stench of the lizard men. We can see a bricked lip of some type of pond/bath(?). We start moving into the room, slowly.
