# Session 2: 01-15-2026:

## After Killing the Old & Blind Lizard Man:

Complete looting: old stick, gorilla furs, knife, stone rod. Engraving/inscription in unknown language on twisty wood stick (approx 2' long).

We exit the room, and go to head deeper into the cavern. There's a gap with some pillars as stepping spots, and on one side is a vine/palm leaf rope as a hand hold. Under the rope is worn smooth, which indicates smaller creatures (approximately the size of a halfling) have most likely brushed against it while crossing over the years, wearing it down (there is a small ledge something that size can use as a foot hold to cross more safely). We use the ladder to push against the pillars, and they sway a bit, creaking and cracking. We decide _not_ to use the pillars, securing the ladder across the gap so we can all make it over at t6he same time (we can hear something making wet slapping sounds).  
We make it across to discover there are two lizard men throwing spears at us.

**_Begin Combat_**
We gain the upper hand and attack first. Hugo the Underpaid (Sam) crosses the cavern/room we're in, swinging his sword at one but missing. Mystiel gets a good whack in on one. I go to shoot an arrow at one but fumble (double 2's) and become entangled in my bow, gaining _disadvantage_ on my next turn.

Hugo goes again, and hits one of the lizard men, slicing off a chunk of the enemy's skin. Mystiel misses on his next shot. I fire an arrow with disadvantage and manage to strike the enemy in the eye socket, killing him. The remaining enemy whacks Mystiel, causing slight damage.

Hugo and I both miss, the lizard man misses as well.

Hugo and I both miss again. Mystiel is up again, swings with his mace, but misses. Lizard man misses again, as well.

Hugo misses. My arrow finds purchase in his shoulder, he strikes out but misses with his claws at Mystiel.

Hugo put the boot to him, knocking him down prone. Mystiel finishes the job with his mace, splattering the lizard man's head with his mace.

There's one more, attempting poorly to hide behind a rock. He has a stone tomahawk in his hand. Hugo yells "we come in peace," but all it does is hiss at us. Looks a little thicker and lighter than the others. Hugo steps into a little pool of water, which seems to enrage it, and it comes at him (maybe it's lizardmen eggs?)

Hugo goes to strike, but fumbles (double 2's). Mystiel hits it and it falls over dead. Hugo and Mystiel smash the rest of the eggs to prevent further issues.
**_End Combat_**

## Past the Rookery:

The room narrows into a path, we can see a round door similar to the one we encountered at the stairs at the entrance to the cavern. Hugo goes down to it (slight slope) and finds a small hole in the center of the door. He slides the rod in. Pushing hard, he is able to unlock the door and we can slide it open about half way. Hugo removes the rod and we enter the next, larger room.

Inside this room, is a slight putrid smell, different from the stench of the lizard men. We can see a bricked lip of some type of pond/bath(?). We start moving into the room, slowly. We find an old decrepid looking guy named "Gray." He states the "Troglodytes" (lizard men) imprisoned him in there (an unknown amount of time ago). We give him a ration and a torch and open the round door with the rod at the south end of the room, leaving Gray there.

We change our minds and decide to go through the door on the east first instead (looking for that big treasure room). Inside that chamber are north and south rooms with massive, open doors. The north room just has broken clay pottery, etc. The southern room, one wall has partially collapsed. Inside are piles of little sticks (max. 4" long) tied together with dyed/colored twine. They have a faint aromatic aroma to them. There are six, we take them.

In the northern room, Hugo goes back and searches. He finds 2 approx. 20oz. stoppered bottles with what sounds to be liquid inside, he takes them as well. Further east are another set of northern/southern rooms. The southern room has some black piles of goop, kind of sludgy. Musty smell in the room.

In northern room #2, we see a glint of metal in the debris of the floor. It's a bunch of coins mixed in. We spend 5 hours collecting 2,535 _Ancient Silver Coins_. It's a _Silver Horde_. That's about 250 gold.

**_Begin Combat_**
Mystiel enters the southern room to check it out, and encounters a massive snake that strieks at him and misses. He strikes out at it and whacks it with his mace; however, it shurgs it off. I miss an arrow shot. It misses at Mystiel again.

Hugo whacks it decently. It retreats back into the room and I slam the stone door, trapping it.
**_End Combat_**

## The Idol Room:

We continue east, opening another round door. When it opens, we smell and hear what sounds like water. It appears to be another large room. At the east side are stairs leading up to a platform where a golden-looking idol is (Idol in Cave.png). It's holding something in front of it that appears clear and green. At it's feet appears to be a copper bowl where things have been burned in the past. We decide to burn one of the bundles of sticks/incense in one of the bowl and stand back and watch.

After a bit of letting it burn, I start hearing a snake hissing behind me no matter where I turn. Hugo starts thinking about what those sticks would taste like. Mystiel begins randomly laughing. Hugo gets out that he thinks if we snag that green object, he feels the wall will collapse and flood our area. I ask Hugo if he hears the snakes. Mystiel goes to the corner and picks his nose. (yes).

Hugo decides to try to pry the green orb from the idol, and the idol starts to tip over. He's able to get the orb free, but the idol crashes over. Jets of water come flooding in. We run out of the chamber, sealing the chamber behind us. It's still flooding. We come into Gray's chamber, I yell at him time to go, he yells back "No, I'm hungry!" and bites me. Hugo or Mystiel boots him into the multi chamber room we just came from, and we seal him into it, and flee up the spiral stairs. We build a makeshift raft as ours is now gone.

As we sail away, the island collapses under the strain of the flooding. It is now essentially the next morning.

We leveled up.

## Back on the Mainland:

We make it back to where we originally launched from, spending the night in the skeleton house from before. The next morning, we travel back to Eck-Endgar.

We go and meet an old, gray, bald monk at the Temple of Jex'Roth to try to sell him the bottles of holy anoitmentment oil (the bottles Hugo picked up in the rooms). We sell the bottles to the clergy and resupply in the lower half of the city at the shops (in "The Bottoms").

## Heading Back Out:

We come across some sugar cane fields and see a bunch of sugar cane farmers standing around looking at where they just started cutting it down. It appears to have a blood-red liquid coming out of it. We ask if it's normal, and they tell us no.

A guy on a horse, carrying a whip, shows up and asks what's going on. We point out the issue with the sugar cane to him. He yells at the farm workers to get back to work, and they do so reluctantly.He tells us this is the third field of his this has happened in, and state's it started about of week ago.

Hugo examines the red fluid and notes it has an iron tinge to it, very similar to blood. We cut a deal with "El Jefe" to try to solve the problem. A worker tells us (for 2 gold) he "told them not to cut that ditch." He said it's back in the fields a bit, and it goes straight into the jungle "where you never go."
