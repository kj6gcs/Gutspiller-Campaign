# Session 1: 01-08-2026:

## We have arrived in Eck-Endgar:

After asking around where we might find some of the old settlements, we convince an old surveyor to draw us a map of some of the trails that lead out of town so some of the old locations. He's a bit kooky and kept referring to the jungle as "She."

We gear up and head north through the fruit plantations. Beyond that, the jubngle - hot, steamy, and crowded - comes upon us quickly.\

## The Jungle:

Everything seems alive. Insects are everywhere. Since we bought bug repellant (bees wax) we are generally left alone. Although there are large bugs there too. The jungle is lush and has nearly overgrown the path.

We come across an old, dilapidated guard house (hewn into the sie of the small cliff to our right), and a guard - dressed as a sentry from Eck-Endgar - steps out of the gaurd house and tells us to halt, that there is a toll. We question his validity. His voice doesn't match his face, his gear doesn't fit right.

**_Begin Combat_**
I walk past it, it does not follow. Hugo throws a dirt clod at it and it passes through it. A horrendus "woman" pops out and attacks us. She gets advantage. After beign hit by my sword, she scales the cliff and runs away. We take loot of 2 SP each, a lantern, oil flask.
**_End Combat_**

She seems to have eaten his upper half. We identify him as "Kevin" by the name written in his boot. Hugo cuts the name out and brings it with us for notification purposes (I think?).

We leave the area further into the jungle and come upon a more "open," less crowded area of the jungle. It has ruins and a bit of flowing water.\

## The Ruins:

It's time to set up camp for the night as the sun is fading fast. While looking in what appears to be an old farm house, we come upon an animated skeleton.

**_Begin Combat_**
He sends to skeleton soldiers to take us down, but they are crushed by Hugo and Mystiel. We enter the building where he was, and Hugo tries to take a stone-etched map from in front of him. He attacks us, and I end up defeating him by kicking his head off.
**_End Combat_**

The map shows a lake and an island in the lake. We set camp for the night, and boil some water for the next day. We set the watch for the night. The jungle is very loud for the night.\

## The Next Morning:

We wake the next morning with an uneventful night. We follow the map to the lake (the misty isles). We assemble a raft using left over steel bands from the left over barrels at the ruins, and we try to make a raft with choppeed down logs, etc. The hammering has brought attention.

A pissed off monkey of some sort runs up and bluff charges us. I try to do the same to him to intimidate, but fail and just piss him off more.

**_Begin Combat_**
I start off by shooting him with an arrow for _1_ damage. He get's pelted with rocks and other blunt objects by Mystiel and Hugo. I shoot him again for _2_ damage this time. Mystiel deals the final blow.
**_End Combat_**

We _finally_ get the raft built and "sail" to the island in the lake. It has some ruins left behind. Per Hugo, he "doesn't see any dancing girls."\

## The Island:

The structure is squat in nature. There is a fould, stomach-churning smell on the island. We encounter lizard men who seeme mad at us, yelling in some sort of language.

**_Begin Combat_**
A fight ensues. Mystiel whacks one across the face with his mace, critically hiting him with double 6's (GUTSPILLER!). The other one runs away, Mr. Eyeball tries but we shoot him down as he flees.
Party Loot: Grimy gold necklace worth 100gp.
**_End Combat_**

We go down the hole, as the stairs led to a massive sealed door. The hole slopes downward, but we tie off a rope to a column to help us descend safely.\

## The Cavern

Using a ladder, we cross a couple narrow caverns and enter. We come across an old blind lizard man. Hugo goes to kill him, but falls on some blood, waking him up. Since he's blind, he doesn't see us and is just sniffing the air. Hugo uses his sling on him and ends the old man's life. Loot: old stick, gorilla furs, knife, stone rod.
